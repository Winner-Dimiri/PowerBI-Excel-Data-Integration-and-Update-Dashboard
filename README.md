# Power BI Sales Dashboard | Excel Integration | Revenue vs Target | YoY Growth | 2025–2026 Update
---
## Project Description
I developed an interactive Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard, integrating 2025 Excel data to update an existing 2024 dashboard while preserving KPIs, visuals, and business logic, in order to track revenue, profit, sales volume, and target achievement.

Key Tasks include:
- Developing an Interactive Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard
- Revenue vs Target Analysis
- Integrating and validating Excel datasets
- Year-over-Year (YoY) growth using DAX time intelligence, KPI Scorecard, calendar-based data modelling, and dynamic Year/Month Slicers
- Delivering scalable dashboard updates, executive reporting, and data-driven business insights
