# PowerBI-Excel-Data-Integration-and-Update-Dashboard
I developed an interactive Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard and integrated 2025 Excel data to update an existing 2024 dashboard, ensuring accurate revenue, profit, sales volume, and target tracking. Features include Revenue vs Target analysis, YoY growth using DAX time intelligence, KPI scorecards, and Calendar-based data modeling.
